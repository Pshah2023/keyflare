# Updated Documentation
## About
KeyFlare v0.4.0 is a useful tool that enables users to interactively control their mouse using their keyboard. KeyFlare can provide an expanded user experience for those who prefer to use a keyboard over a mouse. Showcases available on week 2 or 3 of my [senior project page](https://sites.google.com/email.medfield.net/psp/0?authuser=0).

### Features

- Intuitive keyboard-based mouse control: KeyFlare shows a list of coordinates representing UI elements on your screen that you can click on by typing the unique alphabetical identifier for a coordinate of interest.
- Improved hotkeys: Initating KeyFlare with Left Alt+A+Z combination will click the screen once at the end while the right Alt+A+Z combination will click the screen twice.
- Customizable user experience: A preferences window allows users to change the background color, exit the application, or exit just the current process.
- Enhanced image segmentation algorithm: A novel algorithm that performs Tesseract for this use case.
- Cross-platform compatibility: Automatic building of release for Linux, macOS, and Windows through GitHub Actions ensures compatibility for all desktop environment!

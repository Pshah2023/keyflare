## About
KeyFlare is a useful tool that enables users to interactively control their mouse using their keyboard. KeyFlare can provide an expanded user experience for those who prefer to use a keyboard over a mouse. Showcases available soon on week 5 (old showcases available on week 2 and 3) of my [senior project page](https://sites.google.com/email.medfield.net/psp/0?authuser=0).

### Features

- Intuitive keyboard-based mouse control: KeyFlare shows a list of coordinates representing UI elements on your screen that you can click on by typing the unique alphabetical identifier for a coordinate of interest. 
- Improved hotkeys: Initating KeyFlare with Left Alt+A+Z combination will click the screen once at the end while the right Alt+A+Z combination will click the screen twice.
  - Inputs arguments let you define the number of clicks when run from terminal
- Customizable user experience: A preferences window allows users to change the background color, exit the application, or exit just the current process (or by pressing Return).
- Enhanced image segmentation algorithm that optimizes usability and installation speed.
- Cross-platform compatibility with Linux, macOS, and Windows: all desktop environments!
